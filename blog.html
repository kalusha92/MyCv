        <!-- First Question -->
        <p class="title">
            Relative Size Or Browser Zooming
        </p>
    
    </div>
     <p>There has been a debate about relative size and browser zoom capability for a long time. Some of the arguments were: “Browsers handle all the font zooming for us, so we don’t have to convert our typography to relative units in CSS. So that users do not bother to adjust the font display settings in the browser!”. On the other hand the arguments for using relative CSS units were: “Yes, browsers handle page zoom for us, yet there’s a difference between how the UI appears when the page is zoomed, depending on whether the default browser size has been adjusted as well, that users do bother to adjust the font display settings in the browser so we need to account for that in our CSS declarations.”</p>
     <p>I do agree on the second argument. It is self-evident that using relative size for length measurement in CSS solves a set of problems. For instance, when a design change or amendment need making to the code you can write the new value straight in.
        Principally that em and rem provide some proportional flexibility as you build. Depending upon what you are building, it is an approach that has great merit. When building UI you can combine the way different length units are applied to solve specific problems.</p>  
     <p>Perhaps ultimately, ‘just use relative size’ is the wrong thing to take away. It’s merely important to understand what each choice will buy you and cost you and make a choice accordingly.</p>

    <!-- Second Question -->

                Pixels in Browser.
            </p>
            <p>A pixel is represented by a dot or square on a computer monitor display screen. Pixels are the basic building blocks of a digital image or display and are created using geometric coordinates. Depending on the graphics card and display monitor, the quantity, size and color combination of pixels varies and is measured in terms of the display resolution.</p>
            <p>For example, a computer with a display resolution of 1280 x 768 will produce a maximum of 98,3040 pixels on a display screen. Each pixel has a unique logical address, a size of eight bits or more and, in most high-end display devices, the ability to project millions of different colors.</p>
            <p>On a high-resolution device, A CSS ‘px’ unit (which is 1/96 of an inch) may resolve to a fractional number of device pixels. For example, on a 300dppi (device pixel per inch) screen the ratio of device pixels to CSS pixels pixels is 300/96 = 3.125.
                On a low-resolution device, the specification recommends to “relate the pixel unit to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#reference-pixel">reference pixel</a>  and further advises “that the pixel unit refer to the whole number of device pixels that best approximates the reference pixel”.</p>
            <p> As a consequence, a CSS inch did not always map to an actual physical inch; if a laptop’s true resolution was 120dppi, a 96px-long inch would end up being 96/120 = 0.8 physical inch!</p>

                <p class="title">
                    Changes in CSS3
                </p>
                <p>CSS3 is the latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language and aims at extending CSS2.1. It brings a lot of long-awaited novelties, like rounded corners, shadows, gradients, transitions or animations, as well as new layouts like multi-columns, flexible box or grid layouts.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Transition and Animation</li>
                    <p>CSS animations are finally available in all major browsers, even in IE (since version 10). There are two ways to create CSS animations. The first is very easy, it is done through animating the changes of CSS properties with the transition declaration. With transitions, you can create hover or mouse down effects, or you can trigger the animation by changing the style of an element with JavaScript. You can see the transition below by hovering over the planet - this will cause the rocket to close in.</p>
                    <li>2. Advanced Selectors </li>
                    <p>These days, if you assign IDs to elements only so you can style them, you are probably doing it wrong. CSS 2.1 and CSS 3 introduced a number of powerful selectors that can make your layouts cleaner, and your stylesheets more awesome.</p>
                    <li>3. Gradients</li>
                    <p>Gradients give web designers the power to create smooth transitions between colors without having to resort to images. CSS gradients also look great on retina displays, because they are generated on the fly. They can be linear or radial, and can be set to repeat. They have been around for some time, but after a few minor syntax changes over the last months, they are finally available nearly everywhere, prefix-free!</p>
                    <li>4. Box Sizing</li>
                    <p>The single biggest cause for headaches for CSS beginners is the box model. The standardization bodies have probably had their reasons, but it doesn't feel at all intuitive to have the CSS width and height of an element affected by its padding and borders. This little (mis)feature breaks layouts and wreaks havoc, but finally there is a way to restore our sanity by using the box-sizing rule. You can set it to border-box, which makes elements behave exactly the way you expect. See for yourself</p>
                    <li>5. Layouts</li>
                    <p>Diffrent new layouts has benn introduced in CSS3. The purpose of these layouts is to distribute the amount of space given to the view on which they are installed among the children of that view.</p>
                     <ul>
                         <li>I. Flexbox</li>
                         <p>Flexbox is a layout model that allows elements to align and distribute space within a container. Using flexible widths and heights, elements can be aligned to fill a space or distribute space between elements, which makes it a great tool to use for responsive design systems.</p>
                         <li>II. Grid Layout</li>
                         <p>The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.</p>
                         <li>III. Media Queries</li>
                         <p>A media query consists of a media type and zero or more expressions that match the type and conditions of a particular media features such as device width or screen resolution. Since media query is a logical expression it can be resolve to either true or false.</p>
                     </ul>
